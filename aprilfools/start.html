    <h2>For this april fools day, I made this fun little quiz thing to keep you amused</h2>
    <h2>To answer the questions, replace the word "start" in the URL with the answer (use all lowercase)</h2>
    <p>The first person to to complete all of the questions will get a to-be-determined reward </p>
    <p>(other people may also get rewards depending on how i'm feeling) </p>
    <p>None of the questions are trick questions. Despite it being april fools day, this is not a prank</p>
    <p><i>Use of the internet is encouraged!</i> I would be very surprised if you got these all without it (take that as a challenge!)</p>
    <p>Each question is designed to be obscure enough to send you down a rabbit hole (except the first one)</p>
    <p>Unionization is discouraged. Only one of you can win</p>
    <p>With that out of the way...

  <h1>QUESTION 1:</h1>
  <p>What is my favorite color? (5 letters)</p>
